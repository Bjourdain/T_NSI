    "Functional Programming is a popular programming paradigm closely linked to computer science's mathematical foundations. While there is no strict definition of what constitutes a functional language, we consider them to be languages that use functions to transform data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not a functional programming language but it does incorporate some of its concepts alongside other programming paradigms. With Python, it's easy to write code in a functional style, which may provide the best solution for the task at hand.\n",
    "Functional Programming Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional languages are declarative languages, they tell the computer what result they want. This is usually contrasted with imperative languages that tell the computer what steps to take to solve a problem. Python is usually coded in an imperative way but can use the declarative style if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of Python's features were influenced by Haskell, a purely functional programming language. To get a better appreciation of what a functional language is, let's look at features in Haskell that can be seen as desirable, functional traits:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pure Functions - do not have side effects, that is, they do not change the state of the program. Given the same input, a pure function will always produce the same output.\n",
    "    Immutability - data cannot be changed after it is created. Take for example creating a List with 3 items and storing it in a variable my_list. If my_list is immutable, you wouldn't be able to change the individual items. You would have to set my_list to a new List if you'd like to use different values.\n",
    "    Higher Order Functions - functions can accept other functions as parameters and functions can return new functions as output. This allows us to abstract over actions, giving us flexibility in our code's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haskell has also influenced iterators and generators in Python through its lazy loading, but that feature isn't necessary for a functional language.\n",
    "Functional Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Without any special Python features or libraries, we can start coding in a more functional way."
